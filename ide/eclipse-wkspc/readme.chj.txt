The [.metadata] sub-folder here marks this folder($) as an Eclipse IDE workspace. 

The existing $/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.core.runtime/.settings/org.eclipse.ui.workbench.prefs stores my Keyboard hotkey preferences.
This existing .prefs file will be recognized by Eclipse IDE when this workspace is first loaded by Eclipse IDE.

My keyboard hotkey preferences includes:
* F10 as Step Over.
* F11 as Step Into.
* Shift+F11 as Step Return
etc
